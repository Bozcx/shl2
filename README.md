# Sbox Half Life 2 Mounting

This repo contains a example for mounting Half Life 2 to the Sbox Engine, at the moment this does nothing more then simply telling the engine that hl2 is indeed installed on your pc.
This is nothing more then a simple project I am doing for fun.

# How to Use
1. Build the Solution file
2. Go to `sbox/mount/`
3. Create a new folder that has the same name as the dll `sbox/mount/shl2`
4. Place the dll
5. Mounted
